Here I will be keeping a rough timeline of progress for the project.

11/11/2020:
Fitted GP with a mean function to generated data (predicting rotation given age and BV). Will next be looking into generating my own data set to test the process on. 

12/11/2020
Generted some new sample data (with a slightly different form/shape to the data guy produced) to check if my code worked on other data sets - fit very well :)
