This is an introduction to gyrochronology through the study of two papers.

Gyrochronology is the method of calculating a starâ€™s age based on its rotation period. The rotation of stars decreases throughout their lifetime as they lose angular momentum. Therefore, using cluster of known ages models can be calibrated to estimate the age of a star with unknown age but known period.[1]

The calibration of such model becomes much more effective when the Rossby number is introduced, helping the model depart from a simple power law prediction [2]. The Rossby number is the ratio of the period to the convective timescale. Introducing the number into the Skumanich relation helps to include the effects of the magnetic field strength, mass and metallicity on the rotation period. [2]

The aim of the project will be to use Gaussian Processes to model calibrate and predict the ages of stars using gyrochronology.
